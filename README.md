# ShowFlow
Welcome to Showflow! This application is a social media platform built for TV fans of all kinds - users can see what's popular within their network, see a live feed of watch activity, add shows to their watchlist and participate in a live chat room for each show.

We've all spent hours scrolling through Netflix trying to find the next series to watch only to be caught with 'analysis by paralysis' and reviews from unreliable if not anonymous sources. Binge watching is typically a self-indulgence so its nearly impossible to get recommendations from friends when needed. ShowFlow will streamline the process and ensure you've always got access to a curated list of shows!

# Upcoming Features
Rating system, recommendations, friends lists and private messaging platforms.

# About This Project
This project was built with a series of languages, frameworks and libraries including HTML5, CSS3, Materialze, Javascript, React, Express, Node and MongoDB.

Please see the source code for more information.

# Collaborators
Mike Tuttle, Jeremy Stepanovich and AJ Patel
